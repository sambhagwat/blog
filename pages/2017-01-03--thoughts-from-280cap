#Convo with Prescott Nasser

Interesting guy, will have to reconnect in 8 months

Need a pat intro speech focusing on what I've accomplished as opposed to what I've worked on

The convo went better as it usually does as I focused on asking them questions.

What surprised me about the pitch was that there is that much arbitrage between the muni exchanges (ECLs)

Also that they're building something with traders (!) And as an LLC with buy in.
