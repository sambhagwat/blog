In addition to this blog, I’m guest blogging over at Ribbonfarm; Venkat just published my first post, [Algorithmic Governance and the Ghost in the Machine](http://www.ribbonfarm.com/2013/12/01/algorithmic-governance-and-the-ghost-in-the-machine/). Hopefully the community over there can further stir the juices.

The piece explores a distinction that I’ve been mulling over for a while about the legibility — basically, opacity or transparency from the outside — of data science vs. economics algorithms.

Data science-y algorithms are often pretty opaque (think Google search) where economics-y algorithms are usually pretty transparent (think of the kidney-matching algorithms pioneered by Roth et al.).
